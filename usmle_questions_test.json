It typically affects older children and young adults and presents with painless hematuria that is often accompanied by an upper respiratory tract infection. The hematuria lasts for several days and then subsides temporarily, returning every few months or with another upper respiratory infection (synpharyngitic hematuria). Complement levels are usually normal. Renal biopsy will show mesangial hypercellularity with mesangial IgA deposits seen by immunofluorescence.\nWhen IgA nephropathy is accompanied by extrarenal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, arthralgias, purpuric skin lesions), the syndrome is called Henoch-Schönlein purpura.\n(Choice A) The kidney is often affected by amyloidosis. On Congo red staining, amyloid deposits appear red-pink under light microscopy and have an apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Amyloidosis typically presents in older adults as nephrotic syndrome with significant edema and proteinuria.\n(Choice B) Crescent formation with linear IgG deposits occurs in patients with anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease (Goodpasture disease). This condition generally presents as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with an acute rise in creatinine and decreased urine output; patients also often have hemoptysis. The disease is rare in children.\n(Choice C) Minimal change disease (MCD) is characterized by effacement of podocyte foot processes on electron microscopy. MCD typically results in nephrotic syndrome with generalized edema and high levels of proteinuria; recurrent hematuria associated with an upper respiratory infection is more consistent with IgA nephropathy.\n(Choice D) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) demonstrates granular IgG and C3 deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. However, hematuria in PSGN usually develops 1-3 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis (postpharyngitic nephritis), and reoccurrence is rare.\n(Choice E) Alport syndrome is a disorder of type IV collagen that causes a nephritic syndrome; however, it is associated with hearing loss and ocular abnormalities. Electron microscopy shows a lamellated basement membrane with irregular thinning and thickening (\"basket-weave\" appearance).\n(Choice G) Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis typically causes nephrotic syndrome. Recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria are unexpected.\n(Choice H) Thin basement membrane disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in a thin basement membrane with recurrent microscopic hematuria, gross hematuria, or flank pain. Due to the inheritance pattern, patients typically have a family history of hematuria.\nEducational objective:\nIgA nephropathy (Berger disease) frequently presents as recurrent, self-limited, painless hematuria; episodes often occur concurrently with an upper respiratory tract infection. Kidney biopsy will show mesangial IgA deposits on immunofluorescence. In contrast, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is seen 1-3 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis and is usually not recurrent.\nPathology",

    "explanation": "This patient has numerous clinical findings characteristic of liver cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis, gynecomastia arises from hyperestrinism, which has a number of contributing factors:\nCirrhosis increases adrenal production of estrogen precursors (eg, androstenedione), which are subsequently aromatized to estrogens (eg, estrone)\nEstrogens induce sex hormone–binding globulin production, which results in increased testosterone binding and a further decrease in the free testosterone/estrogen ratio\nImpaired estrogen metabolism by the liver results in estrogen accumulation\nBesides gynecomastia, hyperestrinism in patients with cirrhosis can promote the formation of spider angiomata. Spider angiomata are subcutaneous vascular lesions consisting of a central arteriole surrounded by smaller vessels that blanch on compression. They are most frequently found on the trunk, face, and upper limbs. Spider angiomata are likely due to estrogen-induced arteriolar dilation and are also seen in other hyperestrogenic states (eg, pregnancy). The number and size of angiomata generally correlate with the severity of liver disease.\n(Choices A and F) Altered mental status and a sweet, sulfurous breath odor (fetor hepaticus) are signs of poor hepatic function and accumulation of metabolic toxins (eg, ammonia, dimethyl sulfide). In the healthy liver, ammonia is detoxified to urea, which is then excreted in the urine. In patients with cirrhosis, ammonia accumulates in the blood, resulting in impaired neurotransmission in the CNS and possible brain edema.\n(Choices B and E) Portal hypertension arises from increased hepatic resistance to portal flow at the sinusoids. This causes increased hydrostatic pressure and dilation of the portosystemic collateral veins in the periumbilical system (caput medusae), lower rectum (anorectal varices), and lower esophagus (esophageal varices). Portal hypertension also leads to ascites and venous congestion of the spleen (splenomegaly).\n(Choice C) The liver is the primary site of protein synthesis. Liver cirrhosis can result in decreased albumin production, leading to lower intravascular oncotic pressure with fluid extravasation and pitting edema in the lower extremities (pedal edema).\nEducational objective:\nIn patients with cirrhosis, gynecomastia often occurs due to hyperestrinism, which can also promote the formation of spider angiomata.\nReferences\nGynecomastia.\nPathology",

Antibiotic-modifying enzymes add chemical groups (eg, acetyl, adenyl, phosphate) to a target drug and are the most common mechanisms of aminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin) resistance. Altered aminoglycosides have a reduced ability to bind to the 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to increased minimum inhibitory concentrations and reduced bactericidal effects. Most antibiotic-modifying enzymes arise via transfer of plasmids or transposons rather than chromosomal mutations.\n(Choices A, D, and E) Cephalosporins (eg, ceftazidime), carbapenems (eg, imipenem), and penicillins (eg, piperacillin) are beta-lactam drugs that exert their effect by interfering with the cell wall. Resistance to cephalosporins and penicillins occurs largely because of the bacterial secretion of beta-lactamase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring and inactivates the antibiotic. Carbapenems are not very susceptible to most beta-lactamases due to additional chemical components surrounding their beta-lactam ring; however, resistance to carbapenems can occur due to carbapenemase, which is primarily seen in Enterobacter species.\n(Choice B) Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) block enzymes (DNA gyrase, topoisomerase) responsible for bacterial DNA synthesis. Resistance usually occurs due to genetic mutations that prevent drug binding to these enzymes or to the increased expression of antibiotic efflux pumps.\nEducational objective:\nAminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin) resistance is most commonly due to antibiotic-modifying enzymes. These enzymes add chemical groups to the antibiotic, which diminishes its ability to bind to the 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30s ribosomal subunit.\nReferences\nMechanisms of antibiotic resistance.\nPharmacology",

    "explanation": "Viridans streptococci, notably Streptococcus mutans and S sanguinis , are normally present in the human mouth and are major contributors to tooth decay and the initiation of dental caries. These organisms also cause bacterial endocarditis, deep wound infections, abdominal abscesses, and septicemia. Viridans streptococci can adhere to tooth enamel and to fibrin-platelet aggregates on damaged heart valves due to their ability to produce insoluble extracellular polysaccharides (dextrans) using sucrose as a substrate. This colonization of host surfaces contributes to their ability to cause infection.\n(Choice A) Anterior uveitis (inflammation of the iris) can be caused by infectious processes (eg, herpes viruses, syphilis, Lyme disease) and inflammatory conditions (eg, HLA-B27-related diseases, sarcoidosis). It is not associated with viridans streptococcal infections.\n(Choice B) S bovis is associated with colon cancer, and patients with S bovis endocarditis should undergo colonoscopic evaluation to exclude neoplasia.\n(Choice D) Erythema nodosum (erythematous to violaceous subcutaneous nodules usually appearing on the legs) is a nonspecific finding. It is associated with multiple bacterial infections, most commonly S pyogenes pharyngitis, but also Staphylococcus aureus , fungi (eg, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis), chlamydia, and others. It is also associated with Crohn disease, sarcoidosis, and other inflammatory conditions.\n(Choices E and F) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a type III (immune complex-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction in which immune complexes deposit on the glomerular membrane and fix complement, leading to inflammation, renal dysfunction, hematuria, and nephritic range proteinuria. Migratory polyarthritis is a characteristic of rheumatic fever, an immune-mediated disease. These conditions typically follow infections with group A Streptococcus ( S pyogenes ), which does not produce dextrans.\nEducational objective:\nViridans streptococci produce dextrans that aid them in colonizing host surfaces, such as dental enamel and heart valves. These organisms cause subacute bacterial endocarditis, classically in patients with preexisting cardiac valvular defects after dental manipulation.\nMicrobiology",

    "explanation": "This patient's presentation and the finding of gram-negative diplococci highly suggest meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis . N meningitidis is transmitted by direct contact with contaminated respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets. As a result, people with close or intimate contact (eg, household contacts, kissing contacts, health care workers who directly contacted secretions) are at markedly increased risk of meningococcal infection. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis can prevent these secondary cases if given promptly. A history of meningococcal vaccination does not preclude the need for antibiotic chemoprophylaxis.\nOf the listed agents, rifampin is the only effective choice. Rifampin penetrates well into all body compartments, including the upper respiratory tract, and will eliminate nasopharyngeal colonization. Other effective agents include ciprofloxacin (not routinely used in children due to concerns about connective tissue injury) and intramuscular ceftriaxone, which is effective but not widely used due to the painful mode of administration. Chemoprophylaxis should be given as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Vaccination is an important public health strategy for control of meningococcal disease in general, but does not play a role in post-exposure prophylaxis. Immunity following a post-exposure vaccination does not occur in time to prevent disease.\n(Choice B) A person's risk for infection is 500-1,000 times greater following an exposure to a meningococcal disease patient, and disease onset can be rapid. Therefore, observation alone is not an appropriate strategy for exposed close contacts.\n(Choice C) Although penicillin can be used for treatment of susceptible meningococcal infections, it has not been shown to eliminate nasal carriage or prevent secondary cases. Therefore, it should not be used for chemoprophylaxis.\n(Choice E) Sulfamethoxazole was the first agent to be used as chemoprophylaxis for meningococcal disease. However, it is no longer an effective agent due to widespread resistance.\nEducational objective:\nRifampin is the most frequently used agent for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease. Persons with exposure to the respiratory secretions of a patient with meningococcal disease require chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination is an important public health strategy but is not useful for post-exposure prophylaxis.\nReferences\nMeningococcal disease in childhood: epidemiology, clinical features and prevention.\nMicrobiology",

These animals, along with control animals that had not received the antibodies, are subsequently exposed to the bacteria. Compared to the control animals, a significantly greater proportion of the animals that received the antibodies remain healthy and develop no symptoms.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Neisseria meningitidis is commonly isolated from the oropharynx and nasopharynx of asymptomatic carriers. Colonization rates are variable but highest in close contact populations (eg, military recruits, university students). Transmission of meningococci usually occurs through exposure to respiratory droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions.\nThe pili on the capsular surface of N meningitidis are responsible for attachment to and colonization of the nasopharyngeal epithelium; antibodies against pili are primarily protective due to reduced bacterial colonization, which limits carrier status. However, because pili undergo high rates of antigenic variation (eg, on-off gene switching, horizontal gene transfer), vaccines that target pili have limited effectiveness.\nOther prominent N meningitidis virulence factors include IgA protease (destroy mucosal antibodies that would otherwise inhibit epithelial colonization), capsular polysaccharides (prevent phagocytosis and phagolysosome destruction), lipo-oligosaccharide (an endotoxin that is the major source of toxicity), and opacity proteins (aid in endothelial attachment and invasion).\n(Choices A and D) Vaccines that target endothelial or meningeal invasion would act too late in the disease process to prevent significant illness; once N meningitidis disseminates within the bloodstream, increased circulating levels of endotoxin put patients at high risk for sepsis, circulatory collapse, and death.\n(Choices C and E) Capsular polysaccharides prevent phagocytosis and allow the pathogen to replicate and disseminate within the bloodstream. They also promote bacterial survival within phagocytes by inhibiting phagolysosome destruction. Most existing meningococcal vaccines target capsular polysaccharides.\nEducational objective:\nPili are the primary virulence factor that allow Neisseria meningitidis to initially attach to and colonize the nasopharyngeal epithelial surface. Pili undergo significant antigenic variation, which makes them a difficult vaccination target.\nReferences\nNeisseria meningitidis: biology, microbiology, and epidemiology.\nMicrobiology",

    "explanation": "This patient has purulent arthritis of the knee, oligoarticular joint pain, and a few vesiculopustular lesions on the extremities, raising suspicion for disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). DGI is one of the most common causes of septic arthritis in young, sexually active individuals. It is due to the spread of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from a (usually asymptomatic) genitourinary infection into the systemic circulation. Patients typically present with either purulent arthritis or the triad of polyarthralgia, dermatitis, and tenosynovitis; however, some overlap in these 2 syndromes can occur (as in this patient). Microscopy of blood, urine, or joint fluid samples will often reveal gram-negative intracellular diplococci.\n(Choice B) Salmonella appears as a gram-negative oxidase-negative rod. Patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of septic arthritis due to salmonella. However, salmonella is an uncommon cause of septic arthritis in patients who do not have sickle cell disease.\n(Choice C) Viridans streptococci, a gram-positive alpha-hemolytic cocci in chains, is a common cause of infective endocarditis and can lead to septic arthritis (due to septic emboli). Patients with infective endocarditis can have flu-like symptoms and skin findings (eg, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions). However, vesiculopustular lesions on the arms are much more characteristic of DGI.\n(Choice D) Staphylococcus aureus , a catalase-positive gram-positive cocci in clusters, is the most common cause of septic arthritis. However, most cases in young adults are linked to injection drug use. In addition, the presence of vesiculopustular lesions and oligoarticular arthralgias make gonococcal arthritis more likely.\n(Choices E and F) Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystals that appear as needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Pseudogout is caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals that appear as rhomboid-shaped positively birefringent crystals. Both gout and pseudogout cause inflammatory arthritis (eg, redness, warmth, pain, disability) with elevated leukocyte counts on joint fluid aspiration. However, migrating arthralgias and vesiculopustular lesions would be atypical.\nEducational objective:\nSeptic arthritis in a young, sexually active adult should raise suspicion for disseminated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Patients may also have the triad of polyarthritis, a vesiculopustular skin rash, and tenosynovitis. N gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococci that is usually identified by microscopy, culture, or nucleic acid amplification.\nMicrobiology",

    "explanation": "Acute cervicitis Etiology • Infectious: Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae • Noninfectious: foreign object, latex, douching Risk factors • Age <25 • High-risk sexual behavior Clinical presentation • Asymptomatic • Mucopurulent discharge • Postcoital/intermenstrual bleeding • Friable cervix Complications • Pelvic inflammatory disease • Ectopic pregnancy • Infertility\nAcute cervicitis classically presents with purulent cervical discharge and a friable cervix that bleeds easily with contact (ie, postcoital bleeding). Microscopy showing inflammation (eg, neutrophils) without a visible pathogen is classic for cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae , which are often identified by nucleic acid amplification testing.\nLeft untreated, cervicitis can compromise the endocervical barrier, allowing polymicrobial vaginal flora to ascend into the normally sterile uterus and fallopian tubes. In contrast to cervicitis, infection involving the upper genital tract (ie, pelvic inflammatory disease [PID]) can cause fever, abdominal pain, and cervical motion/uterine/adnexal tenderness due to increased bacterial load and spread.\nWhen the infection extends to the fallopian tube, it creates an inflammatory exudate (ie, salpingitis) that causes the tubal walls to adhere. With prolonged infection, the exudate may be replaced by scar tissue, causing permanent tubal scarring and obstruction that impedes the fertilization and/or implantation of future pregnancies. Therefore, common complications of PID include tubal factor infertility and ectopic pregnancy.\n(Choice A) Primary ovarian insufficiency is the accelerated depletion of oocytes and loss of both ovarian follicular development and estrogen production in women age <40. Risk factors include genetic disorders (eg, Turner syndrome) and chemoradiation.\n(Choice B) Cervical cancer can occur in patients with chronic human papillomavirus infection (eg, types 16 and 18).\n(Choice C) Patients with cervical insufficiency cannot maintain a closed cervix as pregnancy progresses (ie, as the load on the cervix increases); therefore, second-trimester pregnancy loss occurs. Risk factors include prior cervix surgery or inherited collagen disorders (eg, Ehler-Danlos syndrome).\n(Choice D) Increased unopposed estrogen stimulation can lead to endometrial hyperplasia. Obesity is a risk factor due to increased androgen-to-estrogen conversion.\n(Choice E) Recurrent urinary tract infections typically occur when enteric bacteria colonizing the periurethral area ascend the urethra. Certain sexual behaviors (eg, frequent intercourse, spermicide use) promote periurethral colonization.\nEducational objective:\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis can cause acute cervicitis (eg, purulent cervical discharge, friable cervix). Untreated, cervicitis can progress to pelvic inflammatory disease and long-term complications such as tubal factor infertility and ectopic pregnancy.\nReferences\nSexually transmitted diseases and infertility.\nMicrobiology",

Individuals with this condition can develop episodes of jaundice, which may only become evident in the context of a trigger (eg, illness, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use). Otherwise, they are usually asymptomatic with a normal physical examination.\nImpaired bilirubin excretion may result in direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia (eg, usually 2-5 mg/dL), but other routine laboratory tests (eg, complete blood count, liver function studies) are typically normal. Grossly, the liver appears black due to impaired excretion of epinephrine metabolites that accumulate within lysosomes.\n(Choice B) Impaired bilirubin conjugation is seen in conditions such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert syndrome and results in indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia.\n(Choice C) Increased production of catecholamines is not associated with Dubin-Johnson syndrome despite the hepatocyte accumulation of epinephrine metabolites in this condition.

    "explanation": "Glucose-induced insulin release from pancreatic beta cells requires the following steps:\nGlucose enters the beta cell through glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT-2).\nGlucose is metabolized by glucokinase to glucose-6-phosphate.\nGlucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis to produce ATP.\nIncreased ATP levels causes closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels.\nDepolarization of beta cells triggers opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels.\nInflux of calcium causes insulin release.\nGlucokinase has a lower glucose affinity than other hexokinases, which allows it to limit the rate of glucose entry into the glycolytic pathway based on blood glucose levels. It therefore functions as a glucose sensor for beta cells in controlling insulin release.\nHeterozygous mutations of the glucokinase gene that decrease the activity or affinity of the enzyme cause a decrease in beta cell glucose metabolism, leading to reduced ATP formation and insulin secretion at any given glucose level. Glucokinase mutations are one cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mild hyperglycemia that often worsens with pregnancy-induced insulin resistance. In contrast to those with more common type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients with MODY are typically younger and nonobese, and the condition is nonprogressive, even without treatment.\n(Choices A, B, E, and G) Glycolytic enzyme deficiencies (eg, aldolase A, enolase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase) generally present with hemolytic anemia because red blood cells rely completely on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production.\n(Choice D) Lactate dehydrogenase is present in most cells and catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate during anaerobic glycolysis. Deficiency can cause decreased exercise tolerance and muscle stiffness.\n(Choice F) Pyruvate carboxylase, one of the gluconeogenesis pathway enzymes in the mitochondria, catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Deficiency of pyruvate carboxylase causes lactic acidosis and fasting hypoglycemia.\nEducational objective:\nInsulin release by pancreatic beta cells is stimulated by increased glucose metabolism and ATP production. Glucokinase functions as a glucose sensor in pancreatic beta cells by controlling the rate of glucose entry into the glycolytic pathway. Mutations in the glucokinase gene lead to a state in which higher glucose levels are required to stimulate insulin secretion and are a cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young.\nReferences\nGlucokinase MODY and implications for treatment goals of common forms of diabetes.\nBiochemistry",

Cardiovascular mortality is increased by 2- to 4-fold in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and approximately 40% of patients die secondary to coronary heart disease. For a person with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk of dying from coronary heart disease exceeds the risk of dying from any of the other listed causes, even in the absence of other major risk factors for coronary heart disease.\n(Choice A) The risk of breast cancer is not increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Although this patient has a family history of breast cancer, her risk is not significantly increased since her mother was at an advanced age when the cancer occurred.\n(Choice B) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar coma are acute complications of untreated diabetes mellitus. Hyperosmolar coma is seen mainly with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is characterized by very high blood sugar levels without ketoacidosis. The mortality of hyperosmolar coma is higher than DKA; however, very few patients with diabetes die directly from DKA or hyperosmolar coma.\n(Choice D) Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), followed by hypertension. However, approximately 50% of patients with ESRD die due to cardiovascular disease, with infections being the next most common cause.\n(Choice E) The risk of stroke is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, cerebrovascular accidents account for about 10% of total mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus versus 40% from coronary heart disease.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with noncoronary atherosclerotic disease, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease are at the same risk of cardiovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) as patients with known coronary heart disease.

    "explanation": "This patient is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition that most commonly affects patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus due to their absolute insulin deficiency. Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurs in genetically susceptible individuals who are exposed to triggering environmental factors (eg, viral infections, environmental toxins, dietary components). This results in an autoimmune response against pancreatic beta cells that leads to progressive loss of beta cell mass. Overt manifestations of diabetes mellitus tend to develop once >90% of beta cells are destroyed. Although antibodies against islet antigens are detected in a large number of patients, they are thought to play a permissive role in disease pathogenesis; the destruction of beta cells occurs primarily through cell-mediated immunity. Infiltration of islets by inflammatory cells is called insulitis and is more prominent during the early stages of disease.\n(Choices A and B) Abdominal fat deposition and excessive body weight are important contributors to insulin resistance and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Intra-abdominal visceral fat is more strongly related to insulin resistance than is subcutaneous fat.\n(Choice C) Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations that impair glucose sensing and insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. It presents as non-insulin-dependent diabetes at a young age (<25) and accounts for <5% of all cases of diabetes mellitus.\n(Choice D) Islet amyloid polypeptide is secreted along with insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Amyloid deposition occurs in the islets of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although its role as a causative agent of beta cell dysfunction remains unknown. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus have low circulating levels of islet amyloid polypeptide due to extensive beta cell destruction.\nEducational objective:\nAutoimmune insulitis with progressive beta cell loss is the most common cause of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance accompanied by relative insulin deficiency is the main cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nReferences\nAdvances in the cellular immunological pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.\nPathology",

    "explanation": "One of the objectives for the national Healthy People 2020 initiative is to reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking in adults from 20% in 2008 to less than 12% by 2020. Tobacco use, especially smoking, is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. In addition to its numerous direct adverse effects, tobacco smoking also substantially increases the risk for macrovascular (eg, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) and microvascular (eg, retinopathy, nephropathy) complications of diabetes mellitus. These complications significantly increase mortality, primarily by increasing the risk of MI. The risk of MI-associated mortality begins to decrease immediately upon smoking cessation. However, it takes several tobacco-free years before the risk returns to baseline, especially in patients with a long history of smoking. In addition, smokers with diabetes have a higher likelihood of developing hypercholesterolemia, poor glycemic control, and end-stage renal disease. It appears that smoking not only worsens the complications of diabetes but also increases the likelihood of developing diabetes in the first place, thus highlighting the importance of prevention and early cessation.\n(Choice A) Fecal occult blood testing screens for colorectal cancer and improves mortality through earlier detection. Even so, the mortality benefit is much lower than that achieved by smoking cessation.\n(Choice B) Prostate-specific antigen is increased in some patients with prostate cancer. However, annual prostate-specific antigen testing has not been shown to improve mortality from prostate cancer.\n(Choice C) Aspirin use significantly reduces the risk of death from coronary heart disease in diabetic patients, at levels similar to smoking cessation. However, when all-cause mortality is compared, smoking cessation has a greater effect on reducing mortality than daily aspirin therapy.\n(Choices D, E, and G) Dietary modification and exercise reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (to a lesser extent than smoking cessation) and help improve glycemic control in diabetic individuals. Although tight glycemic control has been shown to reduce the risk of microvascular complications from diabetes, it does not significantly improve cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.\nEducational objective:\nSmoking cessation is by far the most effective preventive intervention in almost all patients, and this is especially true in those with diabetes.\nReferences\nHow can we best prolong life?

The toxicity is dependent on the cumulative dose of anthracycline; affected patients develop symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, peripheral edema) anywhere from several weeks to years following treatment.\nAnthracyclines exert their antitumor effect by binding to the topoisomerase II enzyme in cancer cells to create DNA cleavage complexes that break DNA and cause cell death. Anthracycline cardiotoxicity results from a similar anthracycline–topoisomerase II complex that forms in healthy cardiomyocytes. In addition, anthracycline can form iron-containing complexes that produce DNA-damaging free radicals, which likely also plays a role in cardiotoxicity.\nThe most effective method of preventing anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is the administration of dexrazoxane, a chelating agent thought to both block the formation of iron-associated free radicals and inhibit the formation of anthracycline–topoisomerase II complexes in healthy cardiomyocytes.\n(Choice B) Focal myocardial scarring commonly results following a myocardial infarction.\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant disorder often caused by mutation of the beta-myosin heavy chain.\n(Choice D) Pericardial thickening and fibrosis usually follow cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, or viral infections of the pericardium.\n(Choice E) Restrictive cardiomyopathy often occurs as the initial cardiac manifestation of infiltrative disease (eg, hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) or may occur with radiation therapy.\n(Choice F) Right ventricular pressure overload can occur with acute pulmonary embolism. Although this patient with malignancy is at increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease, orthopnea is not explained by acute pulmonary embolism and is more consistent with heart failure.\nEducational objective:\nAnthracycline chemotherapeutic agents (eg, doxorubicin, daunorubicin) cause cardiotoxicity mainly through the formation of anthracycline–topoisomerase II DNA cleavage complexes that affect healthy cardiomyocytes. The cardiotoxicity is dependent on the cumulative dose of anthracycline received, and it manifests as dilated cardiomyopathy.\nReferences\nAnthracycline chemotherapy and cardiotoxicity.\nPharmacology",

    "explanation": "This patient's Pap test shows koilocytes, which are abnormal squamous cells with characteristic cytologic features caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.\nHPV is a sexually transmitted DNA virus with predilection for squamous epithelium (eg, cervix, anus). Active viral replication in infected cells causes cytoplasmic clearing around the nucleus with dense cytoplasm at the periphery, resulting in a perinuclear halo. Koilocytes also have enlarged, dark nuclei with irregular nuclear contours (ie, raisinoid appearance) and may be binucleated.\nIn cervical Pap tests, koilocytes are a hallmark feature of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), a precursor lesion of squamous cell carcinoma typically detected on routine screening (ie, asymptomatic patients). LSIL is usually caused by HPV strains (eg, 16, 18) with high oncogenic risk. Oncogenesis from high-risk HPV is attributed to viral proteins E6 and E7, which inhibit p53 and Rb, leading to unregulated cell proliferation.\nIn most cases of LSIL, the infection is cleared within months by the patient's immune response, and the cytologic abnormalities regress (ie, they are unlikely to progress to a high-grade lesion).\n(Choice A) Clue cells are squamous cells covered with adherent bacteria that obscure the normal epithelial cell margins. They can be seen in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, which involves a change in vaginal flora from lactobacilli to anaerobic, gram-variable rods (eg, Gardnerella vaginalis ) and typically presents with grayish-white, fishy-smelling vaginal discharge.\n(Choice B) Glandular endocervical cells are columnar cells with vacuolated cytoplasm that often form a honeycomb or picket-fence pattern. Their presence in a Pap test indicates adequate sampling of the cervical squamocolumnar junction.\n(Choice C) Endometrial cells have small, dark nuclei with little cytoplasm and are often present in clusters. They may be present in a Pap test during menses and are not clinically significant in young women with no risk factors for endometrial cancer (eg, obesity, chronic anovulation). However, in postmenopausal women, endometrial cells are concerning for possible endometrial cancer.\n(Choice E) Parabasal cells are immature squamous cells with round nuclei, basophilic cytoplasm, and a higher nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. They can predominate in Pap tests from atrophic cervical epithelium caused by low estrogen levels (eg, postmenopausal, postpartum).\nEducational objective:\nA koilocyte is an atypical squamous cell characterized by perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing (ie, halo) and a large, dark nucleus with irregular contours (ie, raisinoid appearance).

    "question": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to diarrhea and vomiting for the last 24 hours. The patient's daughter states that he has been unable to take in much fluid during this time. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide, which he has not taken since the onset of symptoms. Blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and pulse is 105/min. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. Urinalysis reveals concentrated urine with a specific gravity of 1.030. Which of the following changes in renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and filtration fraction (FF) are most likely to be present in this patient as compared with the normal state?",
    "options": [],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Filtration of fluid through the glomeruli depends on the renal plasma flow (RPF) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The GFR is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomerular capillaries into the Bowman capsule per unit of time. The RPF is the volume of plasma delivered to the kidney per unit of time. The filtration fraction (FF) is the ratio of GFR to RPF (FF = GFR/RPF). On average, approximately one-fifth of the plasma that passes through the glomerular capillaries is filtered into the Bowman capsule.\nThis patient is severely hypovolemic due to profuse diarrhea and vomiting. The decline in circulating blood volume is sensed by arterial and cardiac baroreceptors and triggers increased systemic arteriolar vasoconstriction. Renal vasoconstriction further lowers the RPF, which is already decreased due to the decline in circulating blood volume. Decreased RPF causes glomerular perfusion pressure to drop, lowering the GFR and reducing distal tubule sodium delivery. This stimulates secretion of renin and increased angiotensin II production. Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent glomerular arteriole, which increases hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries to maintain GFR (autoregulation). Due to this compensatory mechanism, the decrease in GFR is less pronounced than the decrease in RPF, resulting in an increased FF (Choices B, C, and E). As RPF continues to decline, increasing glomerular oncotic pressure will eventually overwhelm the compensatory increase in hydrostatic pressure, leading to a precipitous drop in GFR and subsequent renal failure.\n(Choice D) Autoregulation improves but often cannot completely normalize the GFR in the setting of decreased renal perfusion pressure. If the net GFR were increased above normal, it would result in decreased renin formation and loss of the angiotensin II-driven arteriolar constriction required to maintain it.\nEducational objective:\nHypovolemia results in a reduced renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This leads to compensatory efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which raises the filtration fraction and maintains GFR at near-normal levels. As RPF continues to decline, increasing glomerular oncotic pressure will eventually overwhelm the compensatory increase in hydrostatic pressure, leading to a precipitous drop in GFR and renal failure.\nPathology",

    "explanation": "This patient's rapidly spreading pruritic rash with erythematous papules and excoriations is suggestive of scabies, or infestation by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. The mite spreads through direct person-to-person contact and burrows into the skin. A history of working in a setting with close interpersonal contact (eg, day care center) is common.\nThe manifestations of scabies are due to a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mite, mite feces, and mite eggs. Patients have an intensely pruritic rash that is often worse at night. The characteristic distribution includes the flexor surfaces of the wrist, lateral surfaces of the fingers, and finger webs; it also commonly involves the axillae and extensor elbow surfaces. Skin examination usually shows excoriations with small, crusted, red papules scattered around the affected areas; vesicles, pustules, or wheals may also be present. Linear burrows are the most specific finding but are often obscured by excoriations.\nDiagnosis is usually clinical but can be confirmed by skin scrapings showing mites, ova, and feces under light microscopy.\n(Choice A) Budding yeast is characteristic of Candida infection, which usually presents with erythematous plaques and erosions with satellite papules/pustules in areas with increased moisture and friction, such as skin folds (eg, axillae, genital areas). This patient's palmar involvement makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n(Choice B) Molluscum bodies are seen with molluscum contagiosum, which is caused by a DNA poxvirus. Lesions may be pruritic but appear as small, firm, pearly papules with central umbilication. Moreover, molluscum contagiosum does not involve the palms and soles.\n(Choice C) Epidermal multinucleated giant cells are seen with herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections. In contrast to this case, HSV causes vesicular eruptions involving the perioral or genital regions, while VZV causes a vesicular rash that is diffuse (primary infection) or of limited dermatomal involvement (shingles).\n(Choice D) Necrotic keratinocytes in the epidermis suggest Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe reaction that occurs 1-3 weeks after an infection (eg, cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma ) or drug exposure.

    "explanation": "Blood circulates in the kidney along the following path: interlobar arteries→arcuate arteries→radial arteries→afferent arterioles→glomerular capillaries→efferent arterioles→peritubular capillaries→interlobar veins. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) normally equals approximately 125 ml/min, although this number can vary between 90 to 130 by gender and between different subjects. The GFR depends on the difference in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures between the glomerular capillaries and Bowman's capsule.\n\nConstriction of the efferent arteriole produces a significant increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure because of the reduction in glomerular blood outflow. This produces a corresponding increase in GFR. Efferent arteriolar constriction also reduces renal plasma flow (RPF). The increase in GFR along with the decrease in RPF leads to an increased filtration fraction (FF) because FF=GFR/RPF (Choice D).\nAs RPF decreases, the slower capillary flow allows more time for the filtration of plasma across the glomerular membrane. This leads to an increased concentration of non-filterable plasma proteins within the glomerular capillaries, thus elevating capillary oncotic pressure. As efferent arteriolar constriction increases past a certain point, this increase in capillary oncotic pressure begins to oppose, and eventually overwhelm, the increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure also produced by efferent arteriolar constriction. Thus, when RPF is low secondary to severe efferent arteriolar constriction, the substantially increased capillary oncotic pressure results in an overall decrease in GFR (Choice A).\n(Choice B) Selective constriction of the afferent arteriole decreases plasma flow into the glomerular capillaries, reducing capillary hydrostatic pressure and thus decreasing the GFR. Constriction of the afferent arteriole results in relatively equal decreases in RPF and GFR (FF=GFR/RPF), so the filtration fraction remains unchanged.\nEducational objective:\nSelective vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole (up to certain extent) increases hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, and therefore increases the glomerular filtration rate. As efferent arteriolar constriction continues to increase, the glomerular filtration rate begins to decrease due to a flow-mediated rise in oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries. The filtration fraction always increases with increasing efferent arteriole constriction.\nPhysiology",

    "explanation": "Hepatic encephalopathy Precipitating factors • Drugs (eg, sedatives, narcotics) • Hypovolemia (eg, diarrhea) • Electrolyte changes (eg, hypokalemia) • ↑ Nitrogen load (eg, GI bleeding) • Infection (eg, pneumonia, UTI, SBP) • Portosystemic shunting (eg, TIPS) Clinical presentation • Sleep pattern changes • Altered mental status • Ataxia • Asterixis Treatment • Correct precipitating causes (eg, fluids, antibiotics) • ↓ Blood ammonia concentration (eg, lactulose, rifaximin) GI = gastrointestinal; SBP = spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; TIPS = transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; UTI = urinary tract infection.\nThis patient with cirrhosis (hepatitis C infection, abdominal distention, gynecomastia) most likely developed hepatic encephalopathy due to his recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Hepatic encephalopathy refers to a reversible decline in neurologic function that occurs due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products such as ammonia. Ammonia is normally produced by the GI tract as a result of enterocytic catabolism of glutamine and colonic bacterial catabolism of dietary protein. GI bleeding causes increased nitrogen delivery to the gut in the form of hemoglobin, which is then converted into ammonia and absorbed into the bloodstream. The ammonia then enters the liver through the portal vein and is detoxified to urea.\nIn chronic liver failure, hepatocyte dysfunction and the shunting of blood through portosystemic collaterals impair the liver's detoxification ability. This leads to accumulation of ammonia and other neurotoxins in the circulation, causing altered amino acid transport across the blood-brain barrier, impaired neurotransmitter metabolism, and depressed cerebral glucose metabolism. These and other factors result in increased inhibitory neurotransmission (eg, γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) and impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release (eg, glutamate, catecholamines).\nIn patients with hepatic encephalopathy, lowering of blood ammonia levels is typically accomplished with oral administration of a disaccharide (eg, lactulose). Bacterial action on lactulose results in acidification of colonic contents, which then converts absorbable ammonia into nonabsorbable ammonium ions, trapping it in the stool and thereby increasing fecal nitrogen excretion.\n(Choice A) Accumulation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is suggestive of renal failure, heart failure, or dehydration. In healthy patients, GI bleeding can also cause a rapid increase in BUN. However, this patient has cirrhosis, which is associated with decreased BUN because ammonia cannot be efficiently converted to urea by the failing liver.\n(Choice B) Bacterial meningitis presents with altered mental status, fever, nuchal rigidity, headache, and photophobia. In addition, asterixis (flapping tremor) is specific for metabolic encephalopathies.\n(Choice C) The altered mental status seen in hepatic encephalopathy is due to increased (not decreased) activity of the GABA neurotransmitter system. This enhanced activity is caused by increased GABA receptor affinity and alterations in neurosteroid synthesis rather than increased GABA production.\n(Choice E) The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and the one most commonly involved in cerebrovascular accidents. This patient's presentation is suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy rather than stroke.\nEducational objective:\nHepatic encephalopathy is caused by increased levels of ammonia and other neurotoxins in the circulation that lead to increased inhibitory neurotransmission and impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release. Hepatic encephalopathy is frequently precipitated by a stressor (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection) that increases blood ammonia levels.\nReferences\nHepatic encephalopathy: a review of its pathophysiology and treatment\nAmmonia, the GABA neurotransmitter system, and hepatic encephalopathy\nPathophysiology",

    "explanation": "Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic pathway enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, resulting in the generation of a molecule of ATP. Allosteric stimulation of pyruvate kinase (by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) stimulates glycolysis. Mature red blood cells (RBCs), which do not contain mitochondria, rely on lactate as the main metabolite for glycolysis.\nMost of the ATP produced is used for transport of cations against a concentration gradient in the RBC membrane. Therefore, pyruvate kinase deficiency, which results in insufficient ATP production, disrupts this gradient, leading to water and potassium loss, defective maintenance of membrane architecture (echinocyte formation), and hemolysis. As reticuloendothelial cells in the splenic red pulp are involved in removal of damaged RBCs, their increased activity in the setting of pyruvate kinase deficiency causes them to undergo hyperplasia, resulting in splenomegaly.\n(Choice A) The spleen is important in fighting infectious pathogens in the body; therefore, many acute and chronic infections lead to enlargement of the spleen due to proliferation of lymphoid tissue.\n(Choice B) Disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma result in splenomegaly from neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid tissue within the spleen.\n(Choice C) Passive congestion of the spleen with blood occurs in the setting of portal hypertension, splenic vein thrombosis, or congestive heart failure. Resultant splenic sinusoid dilation can lead to splenomegaly.\n(Choice D) In infective endocarditis, circulating immune complexes can deposit in the kidneys and the spleen, likely contributing to splenomegaly.\n(Choice F) Splenomegaly in the lysosomal storage diseases Niemann-Pick disease and Gaucher disease is due to the accumulation of sphingomyelin and glucocerebrosides, respectively.\nEducational objective:\nPyruvate kinase deficiency causes hemolytic anemia due to failure of glycolysis and resultant failure to generate sufficient ATP to maintain erythrocyte structure. In this case, splenic hyperplasia results from increased work of the splenic parenchyma, which must remove these deformed erythrocytes from the circulation.\nPathology",

    "explanation": "This patient's multiple previous hospitalizations for alcohol intoxication and easy bruising are indicative of chronic alcohol use. Patients with this condition are frequently deficient in thiamine, a necessary cofactor for several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase (Choices A, B, E, F, and G).\nThe administration of glucose to thiamine-deficient patients can rapidly deplete the small amount of circulating thiamine. This can result in neuronal injury within highly metabolic brain regions, leading to the classic triad of acute Wernicke encephalopathy seen in this patient:\nEncephalopathy (eg, confusion)\nOculomotor dysfunction (eg, horizontal nystagmus)\nAtaxia (eg, unsteady gait)\n(Choices C and H) The metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase consumes NAD+ and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio. This skewed ratio inhibits enzymatic pathways requiring NAD+ (eg, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase), and as a result, the entire citric acid cycle is typically impaired in intoxicated patients. However, this patient has the classic findings of Wernicke encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine (not NAD+) depletion; the only thiamine-dependent enzyme in the citric acid cycle is alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.\nEducational objective:\nSeveral enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (eg, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) require thiamine as a cofactor. The administration of glucose to thiamine-deficient patients (eg, chronic alcohol use) can precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy (eg, acute confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia) due to rapid thiamine consumption.\nBiochemistry",

    "explanation": "This patient most likely has glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease). This condition is caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (alpha-1,4 glucosidase or acid maltase), an enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen within the acidic environment of lysosomes. Although most glycogen is degraded in the cytoplasm, a small percentage is inadvertently engulfed by lysosomes, especially in cells containing high amounts of glycogen such as hepatocytes and myocytes. Deficiency of acid maltase results in pathologic accumulation of glycogen within liver and muscle lysosomes. Cardiac and skeletal muscle are particularly susceptible because the ballooning lysosomes interfere with contractile function.\nThe classic form of the disease presents in early infancy with marked cardiomegaly, severe generalized hypotonia, macroglossia, and hepatomegaly. Blood glucose levels are normal, unlike with glycogen storage diseases that primarily affect the liver (eg, von Gierke disease). A key distinguishing feature is that muscle biopsy will show accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes.\n(Choice B) Galactokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate in the first committed step of galactose catabolism. Galactokinase deficiency causes neonatal cataract formation due to accumulation of galactitol in the lens.\n(Choices C, D, and E) Other glycogen storage diseases are caused by deficiencies of glucose-6-phosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase, and glycogen debrancher enzyme (debranching enzyme). However, glycogen accumulation within lysosomal vacuoles is specific for acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency.\n(Choice F) Pyruvate kinase deficiency causes chronic hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and iron overload as a result of impaired erythrocyte survival.\nEducational objective:\nAcid maltase (alpha-glucosidase) deficiency presents in early infancy with cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and profound muscular hypotonia. Abnormal glycogen accumulation within lysosomal vesicles is seen on muscle biopsy.\nReferences\nLysosomal dysfunction in muscle with special reference to glycogen storage disease type II.\nBiochemistry",

    "explanation": "Many strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae have pili, hair-like protein polymers projecting from the bacterial surface that are involved in organism attachment to mucosal surfaces. When the host produces antibodies against gonococcal pili, mucosal adherence is inhibited. At a given time, only 1 pilus gene is functional, so only 1 pilus type is expressed. However, the structural genes for pilus proteins undergo antigenic variation at a high frequency; they undergo recombination with each other to produce new antigenic types of pili. The number of possible antigenic pilus types is theoretically quite large. This diversity is a reason that vaccine development against N gonorrhoeae pili has been challenging.\n(Choice A) Antigenic mimicry is the sharing of antigenic sequences between the microorganism and the host cell, facilitating immune evasion. The gonococcal lipooligosaccharide is similar in structure to human cell membrane glycosphingolipids. However, this is not related to antibody formation against the pilus. Antigenic mimicry can lead to autoimmune disease if the host mounts an immune response against the infectious epitope and that epitope has sufficient sequence homology with a host antigen.\n(Choice C) Plasmid conjugation plays an important role in gonococcal antibiotic resistance.\n(Choice D) Pilin proteins do not represent a low molecular weight structure that would be poorly immunogenic.\n(Choice E) Gonococcal pili are protein polymers. In addition, vaccines have been developed against non-protein structures (eg, meningococcal vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine).\nEducational objective:\nGonococci use their pili to mediate adherence to the mucosal epithelium.

    "explanation": "This young patient who engages in high-risk sexual activity developed dysuria, frequency, and urethral discharge 3 months ago, indicating infectious urethritis. Gram stain at that time showed intracellular gram-negative diplococci, which is diagnostic for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Because coinfection with N gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis is common, and because Chlamydia cannot be seen on Gram stain due to lack of peptidoglycan in the cell wall, the patient was treated empirically for both infections with ceftriaxone and doxycycline.\nAlthough treatment resolved the symptoms completely, the patient developed recurrent manifestations after additional unprotected sexual encounters, raising suspicion for N gonorrhoeae reinfection. Gonorrhea infection generates IgA and IgG antibodies against the bacteria; however, these antibodies provide limited or no protective immunity against future infections due to an extremely high rate of antigenic variation in bacterial surface molecules (eg, porins, Opa proteins, lipooligosaccharide).\n(Choice A) Memory T cells form in response to gonococcal infection but are not effective at preventing reinfection due to high antigenic variation, which prevents recognition of antigens from the organism.\n(Choice B) The humoral antibody response can be impaired by severe malnutrition; however, the high rate of antigenic variability in gonococcal infection would already preclude development of an effective antibody response.\n(Choice D) Antigenic mimicry occurs when an organism displays similar antigens to the host, preventing the host's immune system from recognizing the organism as foreign.\n(Choice E) Gonorrhea is largely susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) but may be resistant to penicillins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. Antibiotic resistance should be suspected when initial symptoms do not improve with treatment. Because this patient's initial symptoms resolved after he was treated with ceftriaxone and then recurred a few months later, reinfection is far more likely than drug resistance.\nEducational objective:\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae has high antigenic variability of surface molecules (eg, porins, Opa proteins, lipooligosaccharide), which prevents the formation of protective immunity and leads to susceptibility to repeat infection.\nReferences\nNew concepts in immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: innate responses and suppression of adaptive immunity favor the pathogen, not the host.\nMicrobiology",

    "explanation": "In women age <35, infertility is the lack of conception after ≥12 months of unprotected intercourse (Choice C). In women, causes of infertility are often classified into disorders of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries.\nIn this patient with a history of fever, abdominal pain, and vaginal discharge, the cause of infertility is most likely fallopian tube obstruction from prior pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID occurs when a lower genital tract infection (eg, Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Chlamydia trachomatis ) compromises the endocervical barrier, allowing polymicrobial vaginal bacteria to ascend and infect the normally sterile upper genital tract (ie, uterus, fallopian tubes). When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes, it creates an inflammatory exudate that promotes tubal wall adhesion and damage; prolonged infection can result in permanent tubal scarring and obstruction that impede the fertilization and/or implantation of future pregnancies (ie, tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy).\nTo prevent these complications, patients with PID require a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen with coverage for N gonorrhoeae , C trachomatis , and polymicrobial vaginal flora. Treatment typically consists of a cephalosporin (eg, ceftriaxone), doxycycline, and metronidazole. Ceftriaxone covers gram-negative bacteria (eg, N gonorrhoeae ), doxycycline covers gram-positive and atypical organisms (eg, C trachomatis ), and metronidazole covers anaerobic bacteria (eg, Gardnerella vaginalis ). This patient received incomplete antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone only), which likely led to a persisting or prolonged infection and increased risk for tubal scarring.\n(Choice A) Advanced maternal age (ie, age ≥35) is associated with decreased fertility due to the diminishing quantity and quality of oocytes as women approach menopause (average age: 51).\n(Choice B) Chronic ovulatory dysfunction (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome) is a common cause of infertility; however, this diagnosis is unlikely in this patient with regular, monthly (ie, ovulatory) menses.\n(Choice D) Long-term oral contraceptive use is not associated with infertility. Shortly after oral contraceptives are discontinued, patients typically resume menses and return to their baseline fertility level.\nEducational objective:\nTubal factor infertility, which occurs due to tubal scarring and obstruction, is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease. The risk for permanent tubal scarring increases with inadequate antibiotic treatment due to persisting or prolonged infection of the upper genital tract.\nReferences\nUpdate to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020.\nPelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention.\nPathophysiology",

    "explanation": "Building a therapeutic physician-patient relationship requires finding an optimal balance between friendliness and professionalism. First impressions are important, and initial encounters with new patients often set the tone for the ensuing relationship. Using the patient's preferred form of address can help build rapport. Clarifying any uncertainties about pronunciation, titles, or pronouns is important as well. Although younger adults often prefer being called by first name, older patients may take offense at what they consider undue familiarity. When in doubt, the physician should ask patients their preferred form of address.\nAs familiarity develops between the physician and patient, many patients will prefer to be addressed by first name. However, it should be the patient, not the physician, who takes the lead in lowering the level of formality. It is better to ask the patient's preference in an open-ended manner rather than make assumptions.\n(Choices A and B) Although the patient has addressed the intern by his first name, it is still inappropriate to assume that she wants to be addressed by her first name. The patient's preferred form of address should be clarified first.\n(Choice C) This patient has expressed positive feelings toward the intern because he reminds her of her son. Using her surname without clarifying if that is her preference shifts the tone of the interaction and may be perceived as overly formal and distant.

    "explanation": "Erythrocytes use glycolysis as the major pathway to generate energy as they do not have mitochondria and therefore cannot use the citric acid cycle. During normal glycolysis, ATP is generated when 1,3-BPG is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase. However, erythrocytes can bypass this part of the pathway using bisphosphoglycerate mutase, an enzyme that converts 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG in a step that produces no ATP. 2,3-BPG is subsequently catabolized to 3-phosphoglycerate by bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase in a step that also yields no ATP. By generating 2,3-BPG rather than proceeding with regular glycolysis, erythrocytes sacrifice the net ATP gain achieved in normal glycolysis.\nThe major function of erythrocytes is to carry hemoglobin-bound oxygen from the lungs to the peripheral tissues, and 2,3-BPG is a very important regulator of oxygen-hemoglobin binding. The conversion of 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG is increased in hypoxia and chronic anemia. 2,3-BPG allosterically decreases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. As a result, in the presence of lower blood oxygen concentrations, higher 2,3-BPG levels within erythrocytes enable increased oxygen delivery in the peripheral tissues.\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) The enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase is present in large amounts in erythrocytes. However, it is present in insignificant quantities in adipocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, and myocytes; this causes virtually negligible 2,3-BPG production in these cell types.\nEducational objective:\n2,3-BPG decreases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. Therefore, in the presence of lower blood oxygen concentrations, higher 2,3-BPG levels within erythrocytes enable increased oxygen delivery in the peripheral tissues. 2,3-BPG is produced from 1,3-BPG by the enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase. This reaction bypasses an ATP-generating step of glycolysis, causing no net gain in ATP.\nReferences\nDephosphorylation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate by MIPP expands the regulatory capacity of the Rapoport-Luebering glycolytic shunt.\nThe energy-less red blood cell is lost: erythrocyte enzyme abnormalities of glycolysis.\nBiochemistry",

    "explanation": "Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate helps control the balance between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis through inverse regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activates PFK-1, the main regulatory enzyme involved in glycolysis, which converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The opposite reaction (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) occurs in gluconeogenesis and is catalyzed by the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate).\nThe interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is achieved by a bifunctional enzyme complex composed of PFK-2 (increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphosphatase (decreases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels). Insulin causes activation of PFK-2, leading to increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels and augmented glycolysis. High concentrations of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate also inhibit gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased conversion of alanine and other gluconeogenic substrates to glucose.\n(Choice A) Fatty acid synthesis is upregulated by insulin and high citrate levels (which increase when acetyl-CoA is abundant, as with active glycolysis). Therefore, fatty acid synthesis is likely to be upregulated in metabolic states in which fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration is increased.\n(Choice C) The conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is catalyzed by the enzyme PFK-1.

    "explanation": "This patient most likely has McArdle disease (glycogen storage disease type V). This condition is caused by a deficiency of myophosphorylase, an isoenzyme of glycogen phosphorylase present in muscle tissue. Deficiency leads to decreased breakdown of glycogen during exercise, resulting in poor exercise tolerance, muscle cramps, and rhabdomyolysis (eg, red urine). The prognosis is generally good, and symptoms can be improved by consuming simple sugars before beginning physical activity.\nDuring glycogenolysis, glycogen phosphorylase shortens glycogen chains by cleaving 1,4-alpha-glycosidic linkages between glucose residues, liberating glucose-1-phosphate in the process. This occurs until 4 residues remain before a branch point (the limit dextrin). At this point, the debranching enzyme performs 2 enzymatic functions:\nGlucosyltransferase cleaves the 3 outer glucose residues of the 4 that are left by glycogen phosphorylase and transfers them to a nearby branch\nThe enzyme alpha-1,6-glucosidase removes the single remaining branch residue, producing free glucose and a linear glycogen chain that can be further shortened by glycogen phosphorylase\n(Choice B) Glucose-1-phosphate generated by glycogenolysis is converted by phosphoglucomutase to glucose-6-phosphate. Unlike myophosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase is present in both skeletal muscle and liver. Phosphoglucomutase deficiency is extremely rare, presenting with muscle weakness and fasting hypoglycemia.\n(Choice C) Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to 6-phosphogluconate through a series of reactions by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase in the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway maintains adequate levels of reduced glutathione, which is needed to protect from oxidative injury (eg, prevent red cell hemolysis).\n(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase during glycolysis. A deficiency here would disrupt glycolysis, affecting cells that rely on it as their energy source (eg, red blood cells). Patients have chronic hemolytic anemia.\n(Choice E) Within the liver and kidney, glucose-6-phosphatase converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose to help maintain blood glucose levels during fasting. A deficiency here leads to glycogen storage disease type I (von Gierke disease), presenting in infancy with hypoglycemia.\nEducational objective:\nMyophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease, or glycogen storage disease type V) causes failure of muscle glycogenolysis, resulting in decreased exercise tolerance, muscle pain, cramping, and myoglobinuria shortly after initiating physical activity.\nBiochemistry",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "During gluconeogenesis, substances such as lactate and alanine are converted to pyruvate. However, pyruvate cannot be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate directly as pyruvate kinase is unidirectional. To convert pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate first undergoes biotin-dependent carboxylation to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria. This reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase is increased by acetyl-CoA. This critical regulatory step diverts pyruvate to pyruvate dehydrogenase when acetyl-CoA levels are too low, preventing the cell from becoming energy starved. When acetyl-CoA levels are high (as with increased beta oxidation of fatty acids during fasting), pyruvate carboxylase can operate at full capacity and convert most of the pyruvate into oxaloacetate for use in gluconeogenesis.\n(Choice B) Muscle converts pyruvate to alanine via transamination, which is then transported to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate for use in gluconeogenesis. Alanine allosterically inhibits pyruvate kinase, preventing phosphoenolpyruvate from being consumed by glycolysis during the gluconeogenic state.\n(Choice C) Citrate is formed within mitochondria in the first reaction of the Krebs cycle, and elevated levels act as an indicator of high cellular energy stores and abundant biosynthetic intermediates. Citrate is therefore an important positive regulator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively.\n(Choice D) Regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurs mainly through the inverse regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. High levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activate phosphofructokinase-1 and accelerate glycolysis; low levels disinhibit fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and promote gluconeogenesis.\n(Choice E) Lactate is an important source of carbon atoms for glucose synthesis during gluconeogenesis. During anaerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscle, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate formed in the contracting muscles is released into the bloodstream and transported to the liver, where it is converted back into glucose.\n(Choice F) Oxaloacetate is the product of pyruvate carboxylase during gluconeogenesis. As such, increased levels of oxaloacetate would decrease the activity of the enzyme.\nEducational objective:\nAcetyl-CoA stimulates gluconeogenesis by increasing the activity of pyruvate carboxylase when acetyl-CoA is abundant. This regulatory step allows pyruvate to be shunted toward acetyl-CoA production when acetyl-CoA levels are low, preventing the cell from becoming depleted of energy.\nReferences\nRegulation of the structure and activity of pyruvate carboxylase by acetyl CoA.\nAllosteric regulation of the biotin-dependent enzyme pyruvate carboxylase by acetyl-CoA.\nBiochemistry",

RLS is characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs that are often difficult to describe and associated with an urge to move the lower extremities. Symptoms are relieved with movement (eg, walking, stretching) and are typically worse at night. As a result, patients often develop sleep-onset insomnia.\nThe pathophysiology of RLS is incompletely understood but likely involves CNS iron deficiency (even in patients with normal serum iron levels) and abnormalities in dopaminergic transmission. Certain medications, including dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotics, certain antiemetics [metoclopramide]), first-generation antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine), and antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [eg, sertraline], mirtazapine), are associated with worsening symptoms (Choice E).\nTreatment includes lifestyle measures (eg, limiting alcohol and caffeine) and alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands (eg, gabapentin, pregabalin). Dopamine agonists (eg, pramipexole) are alternate agents, but regular use can lead to augmentation of symptoms (ie, paradoxical worsening with chronic therapy) as well as the risk of impulse control disorders.\n(Choice A) Muscarinic receptor antagonists (eg, benztropine) have been used for the treatment of dystonia, which is characterized by sustained muscle contractions usually associated with abnormal posturing (eg, torticollis).\n(Choice C) Opioid mu-receptor agonists (eg, oxycodone) are occasionally used for refractory RLS but carry significant risks (eg, sedation, abuse, respiratory depression). Opioid antagonists (eg, naltrexone) are not useful.\n(Choice D) Beta-adrenergic antagonists (eg, propranolol) are used for treating akathisia (ie, a strong urge to move), which occurs most commonly as an adverse effect of dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotic drugs). Although akathisia is similar to RLS, it is not accompanied by an unpleasant sensation in the legs and does not follow a circadian rhythm.\nEducational objective:\nRestless legs syndrome is characterized by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs accompanied by an urge to move them; symptoms worsen with inactivity and at night and are temporarily relieved with movement.

    "explanation": "This patient likely has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an X-linked recessive disorder causing hemolytic anemia and jaundice in response to oxidant stressors (eg, sulfonamide & antimalarial drugs, infection). Heinz bodies (oxidized hemoglobin conglomerates) precipitate in red blood cells and are removed by splenic macrophages, leaving behind characteristic bite cells.\nG6PD is an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. It generates the reducing agent NADPH, which is essential for detoxification of hydrogen peroxide produced by partial reduction of molecular oxygen in red blood cells. In the absence of NADPH, reduced glutathione (the molecule required for reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water) remains in an oxidized state, and red blood cells become susceptible to oxidative damage.\nGlutathione reductase catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione. Its absence leads to an inability to use NADPH to reduce glutathione, resulting in a clinical scenario similar to G6PD deficiency.\n(Choice A) Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme unique to red blood cells and placental cells. It catalyzes the production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a molecule that binds to hemoglobin and increases offloading of oxygen in the tissues.\n(Choices C and D) Deficiency of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase and pyruvate kinase leads to hemolytic anemia due to lack of ATP generation. However, these conditions would not present with bite cells and the hemolysis is not associated with exposure to oxidant stressors.\n(Choice E) Transketolase, along with transaldolase, catalyzes the nonoxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway, producing the ribose sugar necessary for nucleotide synthesis. The reducing equivalent NADPH is not generated in this portion of the pathway.\nEducational objective:\nGlucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency causes hemolytic anemia and jaundice secondary to increased oxidative stress due to the lack of NADPH.

There may be multiple reasons for nonadherence, including inadequate understanding of the illness and the role of medication, complicated regimens, medication cost, side effects, illness perceptions, treatment beliefs, and psychological factors (eg, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, denial).\nThe best initial approach is to make the patient feel supported by normalizing her difficulty with adherence, followed by open-ended and nonjudgmental exploration of her reason(s) for nonadherence. Once an alliance is established and the specific factors are identified, the physician can more effectively intervene with a targeted intervention. Strategies to improve adherence include educating the patient; simplifying regimens; choosing generic (less costly) medications; addressing side effects and psychological issues; and increasing supervision, monitoring, and follow-up.\n(Choices A and D) It would be inappropriate to recommend a change in medication or addition of a second medication without first addressing her likely nonadherence. These interventions could be considered if her blood pressure remained poorly controlled despite medication adherence.\n(Choice B) Reviewing the patient's regimen and offering suggestions on how to improve adherence would be premature without first understanding the patient's perspective and exploring her specific concerns about taking her medication.\n(Choice E) If the patient seemed reluctant to discuss her medication usage with her husband in the room, the physician might suggest that they speak with her husband not present. There is no evidence to suggest that this is necessary at this time.\n(Choice F) Although assessing the patient's understanding of hypertension is important in providing targeted education, this statement aligns the physician with the husband rather than with the patient. She may feel attacked, which could put her on the defensive.\nEducational objective:\nIdentifying and managing nonadherence is critical to improving outcomes for many chronic conditions, including hypertension. Creating an alliance by validating the patient's perspective and using an open-ended, nonjudgmental question is the most effective way to initiate a discussion.\nReferences\nHow do providers assess antihypertensive medication adherence in medical encounters?\nMedication adherence in a sample of elderly suffering from hypertension: evaluating the influence of illness perceptions, treatment beliefs, and illness burden.\nBehavioral science",

    "question": "An intern attends a local dinner party and recognizes a colleague who works at the same hospital in another department. During the course of the evening, she observes her colleague responding to a number of routine medical calls from the hospital and consuming several alcoholic drinks. Later that evening, the physician notices that her colleague is giving medication orders over the phone and appears grossly intoxicated with slurred speech. The physician confronts her colleague, asking him to transfer on-call responsibilities for the sake of patient care. He insists that he is fine, is not drunk, and that his duties end in 30 minutes anyway. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",

    "explanation": "Physicians are ethically and legally obligated to report impaired colleagues in a timely manner. This physician is in the uncomfortable position of knowing that a colleague is intoxicated while on duty. Although it is unclear whether this is a one-time occurrence or part of a pattern of more extensive impairment, the physician is obligated to intervene immediately because patient safety is at risk. The colleague's immediate supervisor should be informed so that the situation can be dealt with as quickly as possible.\nRisks of not intervening include harm to patients and failure to obtain necessary evaluation and treatment for the physician, which can negatively impact his health, career, and family. Most hospitals and state medical boards have regulations requiring physicians to report impaired colleagues. This can usually be done anonymously. In a non-emergency situation, a person should contact the designated hospital committee, commonly called a physician health program (Choice E). If this is not possible or such a body does not exist, then the state licensing board should be contacted (Choice F). It is the committee or board's responsibility to systematically gather all the facts and arrange for a comprehensive assessment and intervention if necessary.\n(Choice B) The physician confronted the colleague with no response, and harm can still be done to a patient in 30 minutes. A claim of confronting a colleague is not a substitute for reporting the incident.\n(Choices C and D) Witnessing the physician's on-duty intoxicated behavior is sufficient reason to intervene as patient care may be in jeopardy. Whether there is direct evidence of harm or the physician has an established pattern of problem behavior is irrelevant.\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians are ethically and legally obligated to report impaired colleagues in a timely manner. Reporting protects patient safety and can assist the impaired physician in receiving appropriate evaluation and treatment.\nReferences\nImpaired physicians.\nPhysicians' willingness to report impaired colleagues.\nBehavioral science",

    "explanation": "Medically important fungi Cutaneous • Dermatophytosis (eg, tinea, onychomycosis) • Pityriasis versicolor Subcutaneous • Sporotrichosis Systemic • Histoplasmosis • Coccidioidomycosis • Blastomycosis Opportunistic • Candida • Aspergillus • Mucor • Rhizopus\nPityriasis versicolor (also called tinea versicolor) is characterized by hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, or erythematous macules or patches on the upper body. It is caused by Malassezia species yeasts, and the infection is confined to the stratum corneum of the skin. It is common in areas with hot and humid climates and is often most visible after extensive sun exposure due to tanning of the adjacent skin. Most cases of pityriasis versicolor occur in healthy individuals with no underlying immunologic deficiencies.\nThe diagnosis of pityriasis versicolor is made by potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of skin scrapings. Malassezia forms spores and hyphae, producing the characteristic \"spaghetti and meatballs\" appearance on light microscopy. The hyphae have a short, \"cigar-butt\" appearance. This condition is treated with topical antifungal agents or selenium-containing shampoo.\n(Choices A and C) Blastomycosis is characterized by progressive pulmonary infection. Skin involvement is uncommon but can manifest as papular or pustular lesions in exposed areas. Histoplasmosis also most commonly causes pulmonary disease, though it may become disseminated in immunodeficient patients.\n(Choice B) Intertrigo is characterized by well-defined erythematous plaques with satellite vesicles or pustules in warm, moist skin areas (eg, axillae, groin, skin folds). The infection is usually due to Candida species, and it is most common following antibiotic use or in immunocompromised states (eg, uncontrolled diabetes).\n(Choice E) Microsporum species are a frequent cause of tinea capitis and tinea corporis.\n(Choice F) Rhizopus is a major cause of mucormycosis, which is characterized by invasive, necrotic upper and lower respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients.\n(Choice G) Sporothrix molds are found in decaying horticultural matter and are acquired through breaks in the skin. They cause nodular and ulcerating subcutaneous lesions.\nEducational objective:\nPityriasis versicolor (tinea versicolor) is a superficial skin infection caused by Malassezia species. It causes erythematous, hyper- or hypopigmented macules and patches.
